        Sri Lanka, an island located in the Indian Ocean, is known for 
        its diverse animals and stunning natural surroundings. One of the 
        country's noteworthy residents is its thriving turtle population, 
        which has caught the interest and admiration of both locals and visitors.
         These turtles play a crucial role in maintaining the ecological 
         balance of Sri Lanka's marine ecosystems.Conservation efforts in 
         Sri Lanka have been pivotal in safeguarding the turtle population. 
         Along the coast, numerous turtle conservation programs and dedicated turtle
          hatcheries have been built. These programs seek to maintain turtle nesting 
          sites, monitor turtle populations, and increase awareness about the need of 
          turtle conservation.Join us as we discover the beauty and magic of these wonderful 
          creatures that grace the coasts of this amazing island nation.

                        <p>
                            The coastal areas of Sri Lanka are home to a diverse range
                             of turtle species.These turtles, each with their own distinct 
                             qualities, contribute to the rich biodiversity and natural 
                             attraction of Sri Lanka's marine environments.These turtles 
                             are exceptional swimmers, managing the ocean currents with 
                             their streamlined bodies and powerful flippers. Furthermore, 
                             these turtles exhibit exceptional nesting patterns, returning 
                             to the same beaches year after year to lay their eggs. 
                             Sri Lankan turtles symbolize perseverance and flexibility, 
                             flourishing in coastal areas while playing an important part 
                             in the island's delicate marine ecosystems.

                        <p>
                            The Hikkaduwa Hatchery and Rescue Center 
                            is a facility with the mission of protecting some 
                            of the world's most endangered species of turtles. It 
                            is located a few kilometers north of the main Hikkaduwa town. 
                            It is just one of numerous turtle hatcheries along the 
                            island's southern coast. Originally created as a community 
                            project to help safeguard the southern coast's biodiversity,
                             it is now a fully-fledged hatchery and rescue facility 
                             with devoted personnel that are on duty 24 hours a day to 
                             study, look after, and safeguard various turtle species. 
                         </p>
                         
                         <p>
                            The hatchery and rescue facility currently cares for five 
                            different species of turtles. These species include the Green 
                            Turtle, Hawksbill Turtle, Leatherback Turtle, and Olive Ridley 
                            Turtle. Modern water tanks are included in the facilities at 
                            the sea turtle hatchery and rescue center, which also cares 
                            for adult turtle species that have been pulled from the water 
                            after suffering injuries.

                        <h3>Threats To Turtles</h3>
                        <p>
                            When looking at threats to turtles, numerous factors, 
                            such as habitat loss, climate change, unsustainable 
                            fishing methods, pollution, and illegal wildlife 
                            trafficking, pose risks to turtle populations. Important 
                            nesting grounds and ecosystems are destroyed by 
                            human activities including coastal development, 
                            deforestation, and pollution. Nesting beaches and 
                            hatchling sex ratios are affected by climate change. 
                            Bycatch and becoming tangled in fishing gear have an 
                            influence on turtles as well. Ingestion and entanglement 
                            are two ways that pollution, especially marine debris, 
                            can be dangerous. Turtles are the target of illegal 
                            wildlife trade for their shells, flesh, and as pets.
                             Without prompt conservation measures, turtles face 
                             extinction risk due to a combination of stressors, 
                             limited reproduction rates, and other factors.
