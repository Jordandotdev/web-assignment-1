                attraction of Sri Lanka's marine environments.These turtles 
                are exceptional swimmers, managing the ocean currents with 
                their streamlined bodies and powerful flippers. Furthermore,

                            <p>The Sri Lankan green turtle (Chelonia mydas) is an 
                                attractive and iconic animal that captivates both nature 
                                enthusiasts and conservationists. The green turtle, 
                                known for its gorgeous emerald-colored carapace, is one 
                                of the world's largest marine turtle species, reaching 
                                astounding sizes. These beautiful creatures play an important 
                                role in the marine ecosystem, grazing on seagrasses and 
                                algae to help keep coastal habitats healthy.

                                Carnivores predominate among young green turtles. Adults, however, 
                                are herbivores that use their 
                                sharply serrated jaws to only consume marine flora.
                                They can weigh up to 250 kg and reach a maximum length of 1m. A mature female will typically lay 120–140 eggs at a cycle.
                                Green turtles depend on the coastal regions of Sri Lanka for 
                                their nesting grounds, and there are numerous communities with 
                                dense populations. The southernmost town on the island, Rekawa, 
                                is well known for having a sizable number of green turtle nests.
                                 A similar hotspot for green turtle nesting activity is Kosgoda,
                                  which is situated along the southwest coast.

                                    Despite challenges like habitat loss and illicit poaching, concerted 
                                    conservation initiatives are under work in these places and others

                                    worldwide scale. Sri Lanka demonstrates its
